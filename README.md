This is a sample project in NodeJS, showing how to implement a Lambda function used for Trigger functionality in Gridly.

## Prerequisities

* `npm`
* This sample uses [Google Cloud API](https://cloud.google.com/apis) for the text translation, so check this [Creating a service account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started#creating_a_service_account) for how to create your own Google service account JSON file.

## How to build project into a Zip package

In the project directory, do:

1. `npm install` to install library packages
2. Edit `.env` file to replace your Gridly API key and your Google service account key file path.
3. Select all files and compress them into a zip file
    * Make sure the hidden file `.env` is shown by `Command + Shift + .`
    * Select all files by `Cammand + A`
    * Right click + `Compress...`
